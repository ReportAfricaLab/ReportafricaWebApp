        <Section title="Our Mission">
          ReportAfrica is Africa's citizen-powered live reporting platform. We empower everyday Africans to document, share, and verify events happening in their communities in real time — from traffic incidents and emergencies to government accountability and elections.
        </Section>
        <Section title="Our Story">
          Born out of the need for trustworthy, real-time information across Africa, ReportAfrica was built to give citizens a voice. Traditional media often can't cover the breadth of events happening across the continent. We bridge that gap by turning every citizen into a verified reporter.
        </Section>
        <Section title="Coverage">
          ReportAfrica operates across 32+ African countries including Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and many more.
